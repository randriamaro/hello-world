Hello world!
Tiana here. I am a phD student in economics at Washington State University. When I am not studying, you will see me doing one of four things: working out, eating, sleeping, or watching TV. Life is so simple, why complicate it? Right! One's got to relax and take care of one's body and health. That's it.
